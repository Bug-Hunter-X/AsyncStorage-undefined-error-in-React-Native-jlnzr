In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, a common error is encountering a TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.getItem') or similar errors related to AsyncStorage being undefined. This often happens because AsyncStorage isn't properly imported or linked, especially in projects that use a modular structure or third-party libraries that might interfere with the import process.
